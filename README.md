📌 Overview

This application allows a user to play Tic Tac Toe against a computer that makes intelligent decisions rather than random moves.

The system is built using structured programming principles with clear separation of concerns through reusable functions.

🧠 AI Decision Strategy

The computer follows a deterministic priority model:

Win if possible – Check all available moves to see if a winning move exists.

Block opponent – Prevent the player from winning in their next move.

Take strategic positions:

Corners (highest priority positional advantage)

Center

Side positions

This layered evaluation ensures competitive gameplay and demonstrates rule-based AI logic.
